Plugin::Installer is a top-half handler for 
Plugin::Language::* modules. Their AUTOLOAD 
blocks trap un-installed plugins, pass them to 
the compiler, and handle the returned coderef.

Plugin::Installer takes whatever referent the
caller hands back and installs it via a glob-ref
as the name the method was invoked as. This
allows the compiler to hand back non-code-ref
values for installation into a namespace as 
hashes, arrays, etc.


Normal plugin use will have a handler and compiler:

    package plugin;

    use base qw( Plugin::Installer Plugin::Language::DML );

with the Language defining a "compiler" method 
(passed the object and name) and the 
Plugin::Installer locting the compiler and dealing
with post-compile dispatch and symbol install.
